A patch for Zoia EuroBuro

An effect for sparse and intermitten FX artifacts achieved by sending the audio feed into a looper. 
The audio is split into a {dry and a loop} signal, The dry feeds into the FX while the other signal goes 
to a looper and a granular module then out to the same FX chain.

Finished with tone control to cut out low end.

You can see a demo on my youtube channel @zulteric
